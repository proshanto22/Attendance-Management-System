# Attendance-Management-System
A web application to manage attendance for students
“Attendance Management System” is software developed for maintaining the attendance of the student on the daily basis in the college. 
Here the staffs, who are handling the subjects, will be responsible to mark the attendance of the students. 
Each staff will be given with a separate username and password based on the subject they handle. 
An accurate report based on the student attendance is generated here. 
This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. 
Report of the student‟s attendance on weekly and monthly basis is generated.
